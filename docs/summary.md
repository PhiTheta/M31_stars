## Current Steps
- The [PHAT](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/phat/datalist.html) data is available in the form of about 23 'bricks' as shown in the picture on the link above. For each of the bricks, we attempted to download the positions of stars from the 'V2 Star File' on pages like [this](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/hlsp/phat/brick04/). This was done by the [script](../scripts/download_brick_corners.py) and saved to [a csv file](../scripts/corners.csv).
- We then find all of the available ZTF science images (MSIP + Partnership) that should overlap these corner locations and download them. The complete list of images is given by the unique combination of the `expid` and `rcid` of the images. We download the metadata and then the science images itself using the [script](../download_images.py) (will need a user/passwd setup to run). These are stored in [the snova machines](/nfs/brahe/ZTF/ZTF_sci_images/).
